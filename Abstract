    The project entitled “Smart Resource Scheduler” deals with the perfect utilization of equipments. 
    This will help the site managers to manage and  search the resources  easily and effectively. It also  
    provides the facility to rent equipments. Handing  resources manually is impractical so we have to  
    develop a system which will easily schedule, track and maintain the equipments. And also it will 
    eliminate the guesswork of tedious scheduling and routing to maximize on-time delivery. There  
    will be an administrator  login which is accessed by the admin who has full permission. 
 
    Another important concept in Smart Resource Scheduler with Shortest  Path is, it allows users to  
    rent equipment from places with shortest path.
